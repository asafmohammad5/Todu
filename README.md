[See it here](https://todu-now.herokuapp.com/)

Todu! is a Trello clone with some slight differences. With the Todu! app, you can create a project or many projects and have them displayed on your main page. Within each project, you have the power to add other users, lists, and cards. The cards themselves will hold your due dates, descriptions, checklists and comments. Just click on a card and all the information will be pulled up.
