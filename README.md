# Todu!

[See it here](https://todu-now.herokuapp.com/)

Todu! is a Trello clone with some slight differences. With the Todu! app, you can create a project/projects and have them all displayed on your main page. Within each project, you have the power to add other users, lists, and cards. The cards themselves will hold your due dates, descriptions, checklists and comments. Just click on a card and all the information will be quickly accessible.

The project was built using Rails and Postgres for backend, while React/Redux was used for frontend.
